A powerful image enhancement application that uses Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) to upscale and improve the quality of images. This tool delivers professional-quality image enhancements with 4x upscaling, making it perfect for improving low-resolution photos, restoring old images, and enhancing visual content.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Enhancement**: Uses ESRGAN model for high-quality 4x upscaling
- **Multiple Processing Modes**: Single image and batch processing capabilities
- **Intuitive UI**: Modern, responsive interface with drag-and-drop functionality
- **File Support**: Process JPG, PNG, and GIF image formats
- **User Feedback System**: Rate enhancements and track performance in Excel
- **GPU Support**: Accelerated processing with NVIDIA GPUs

## üöÄ Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy the project on your local system:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-enhancer.git
cd image-enhancer
```
### 2. Set Up Python Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 3. Set Up ESRGAN Model
The application will automatically download the required model weights on first use, or you can manually download them:

### 4. Start the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

### 5. Open the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:5000
